# Fillit_42

My first projet !

Fillit is a project that allows you to discover and / or familiarize yourself with a recurrent problem in programming: the search for an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, within a reasonable time. In the case of this project, it will be a question of arranging Tetriminos between them and to determine the smallest possible square that can accommodate them.

The subjet of this projet can be found here in french : https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/734/fillit.fr.pdf and here in english : https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/1453/fillit.en.pdf
