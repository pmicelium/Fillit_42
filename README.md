# Fillit_42

My first projet !

Fillit is a project that allows you to discover and / or familiarize yourself with a recurrent problem in programming: the search for an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, within a reasonable time. In the case of this project, it will be a question of arranging Tetriminos between them and to determine the smallest possible square that can accommodate them.
